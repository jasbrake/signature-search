## General Dynamics (Signature Searching) Challenge

### Challenge Summary

We are in need of a webpage that contains a search where we can enter a signature ID and it will obtain all relevant information from a back-end database.  Keeping a historical trail of signature downloads would also be a valuable asset for comparison between old and new signatures.  This will provide an avenue for all analysts to quickly search for signature(s) relevant to an alert.

### Challenge Requirements

-	A webpage developed using a format of the developers choosing
- Include a search area for typing in a signature id for finding the signature in the database
-	Create a User account for login that has read only access
-	Create an Admin account for login that has full control
-	**Securely code the requirements for logins
-	A database on the backend developed using software of the developers choosing
-	Database will be populated with publicly available open source signatures from Snort
